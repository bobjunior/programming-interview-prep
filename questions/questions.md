0. Given an array of distinct integer values, count the number of pairs of integers that
have difference k. For example, given the array {1, 7, 5, 9, 2, 12, 3} and the difference
k = 2, there are four pairs with difference 2: (1, 3), (3, 5), (5, 7), (7, 9).
0. Print all positive integer solution to the equation a^3 + b^3 = c^3 + d^3 wehre a,b,c, and d are integers between 1 and 1000.
0. Given a smaller string 5 and a bigger string b, design an algorithm to find all permuta-
tions of the shorter string within the longer one. Print the location of each permutation.
0. A ransom note can be formed by cutting words out of a magazine to form a new
sentence. How would you figure out if a ransom note (represented as a string) can be formed
from a given magazine (string)?
0. Design an algorithm to print all permutations of a string. For simplicity, assume all char-
acters are unique.
0. Numbers are randomly generated and stored into an (expanding) array. How would
you keep track ofthe median?
0. Given two sorted arrays, find the number of elements in common. The arrays are the same length
and each has all distinct elements.

    | Array | 1  | 2  | 3  | 4  | 5  | 6  | 7  | 
    |-------|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
    | A     | 13 | 27 | 35 | 40 | 49 | 55 | 59 |
    | B     | 17 | 35 | 39 | 40 | 55 | 58 | 60 |
